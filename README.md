## Description
This project creates a html team organizer for any group. This application takes in information from the command line and turns it into an html file with all of the information needed for team to organize all of their groups information. This application required both an understanding of JS and also an understanding of how to use Node to utilize information from the command line. While there were some struggles putting together the components question in order using multiple functions I could manipulate the order of the prompts.

## Installation
Since this project is not a deployed site a user would need to fork a copy from the original GitHub repository and run it in their own system like VS code or a terminal within gitHub. 

## Usage
To use this application the user must start by navigating to the folder within their terminal or bash. Once
there, the user needs to type in `npm i` then `node index.js` this will prompt them with multiple questions that the user can answer with information from their team. After the user has answered all of the questions the html file will be created with their responses within the dis folder.
